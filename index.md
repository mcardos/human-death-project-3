## Who did we made it for?
The big idea behind this game is to create a fun, family game that combines the aspects of several of our favorite games. We have the Whack-a-Mole style buttons; the Sims styled goal of keeping things alive and the cute Animal Crossing visuals. 

## Who we are:
The code and this website was developed by Maria and Deng. 
Maria and Deng are both students at Babson College who decided to take a coding class at Olin College despite not knowing any Python. But they came up with this beautiful game.
